# ACE - Technical Case Study:

### Introduction
Congratulations and welcome to the technical boot camp for data engineers! In this exercise, you will practice data modeling
and coding in PySpark to build data products that provide insights into our supply chain. Your goal is to help us build a
connected world where everyone makes smart decisions and acts with impact. As a data engineer, your mission is to:

    ● Map real-world data into connected data products through business-driven data modeling.
    ● Support decision-making by creating a data model that depicts entities, events, alerts, and their relationships.
    ● Empower thousands of users to leverage insights and act with impact.

### Exercise Overview
You will work with data from two SAP systems that have similar data sources. Your task is to implement and integrate this data to provide a unified view for supply chain insights. The exercise involves:

    ● Processing Local Material data.
    ● Processing Process Order data.
    ● Ensuring both datasets have the same schema for harmonization across systems.
    ● Writing modular, reusable code with proper documentation.
    ● Following best-in-class principles for flexibility and maintainability.
